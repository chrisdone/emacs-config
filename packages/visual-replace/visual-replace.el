;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file provides the command `visual-replace', which provides a nicer
;; frontend for the commands `replace-string', `replace-regexp',
;; `query-replace' and `query-replace-regexp'.
;;
;; `visual-replace` allows editing both the text to replace and its
;; replacement at the same time and provide a preview of what the
;; replacement would look like in the current buffer.
;;
;; For details, see the documentation, at
;; https://visual-replace.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ or in the Info
;; node visual-replace, if it is installed.
